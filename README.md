# Fast Callout

This is minimal plugin that makes creating callouts in Obsidian faster and more natural.

If you type `;ex` or `@example` (you can choose!), it'll expand it to the Obsidian callout syntax and place your cursor where the title should be.

## Features

### Callout Nicknames

Nicknames keep you in the flow of what you were writing.

## Settings

You can also use custom predefined trigger prefixes like `;` or `!` if you don't want to use `@`. 
If you want to add custom callouts or nicknames, you can do that also!

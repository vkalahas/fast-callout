# Fast Callout

This is minimal plugin that makes creating callouts in Obsidian faster and more natural.

If you type `@example`, it'll expand it to the Obsidian callout syntax and place your cursor where the title should be.

## Demo

## Settings

You can also use custom predefined trigger prefixes like `;` or `!` if you don't want to use `@`.
